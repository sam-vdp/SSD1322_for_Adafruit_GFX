# SSD1322_for_Adafruit_GFX
SSD1322 OLED Library to use with the Adafruit GFX/GrayOLED Library  
  
License: BSD  
  
Forked in 09/2021 from the Adafruit SSD1327 Library (https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_SSD1327)  
and modified for the SSD1322 Display Controller with 256x64 Pixel OLED Display Size.  
Other OLED Resolutions and Interfaces (I2C,3SPI,6800,80xx) are currently (2021-09-14) untested.  
Tested with the **ESP32 and ESP32-S3** MCU and the **SPI** Interface.  
  
Beside the Hardware specific modifications I implemented the function  
`[device].draw4bppBitmap(const uint8_t bitmap[])`  
to draw a 4-Bit Fullsize Grayscale Picture (256x64 Pixels, 8192 bytes) into the Display "Buffer".  
You need to run `[device].display()` after this command to get the Picture shown.  
  
Most Functions write the Data Bytes into the Display Buffer.  
You need to run `[device].display()` to see the result.  
  
### Working/Tested functions:  
|Function Name|Function|  
|:---|:---|  
|begin [1]|Init Display|
|oled_data [1]|Send Data Bytes to the Display|
|display [1]|Update Display Content/Copy Display-Buffer Data the Display|
|clearDisplay [1]|Clear Display|
|setContrast [1]|Set Display Contrast 0..255|
|displayOff [1]|Switch Display off|
|displayOn [1]|Switch Display on|
|draw4bppBitmap [1]|Draw 4bpp Picture|
|invertDisplay [1]|Invert Display Content|

Functions with an [1] are SSD1322 related functions.  
The others are from Adafruit's GFX/Greyscale Libraries.  
  
Succesful tested with "U8g2_for_Adafruit_GFX" https://github.com/olikraus/U8g2_for_Adafruit_GFX to get better text/font support.  
  
GFX/Greyscale Library Notes
 * The Library Command `drawGrayscaleBitmap` is not usable for an SSD1322 OLED as they are for 8-Bit Displays.  
 * The base font has his base on top-left, the additional font on bottom-left.  
 * The additional fonts don't overwrite themself even Text Color is set to (fg-color,bg-color).  

**Note** This library doesn't honor the "dirty window" (modifed pixels) as it redraws every time the full Display.  
  
❗ Work in Progress ❗
